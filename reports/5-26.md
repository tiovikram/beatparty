### Section 1: Team Report
*Goal for last week:*  
1. Add a way to run app both locally and remotely
2. Connect frontend and backend remote deployments
3. Work on a stretch goal, specifically authorization through Google to make sure we don't have infinite voting
  
*Goals accomplished this week:* 
1. Extract user information from Google Users for authentication in application.
2. Updated vote API to account for new authentication functionality in application.
3. Learned how to use Spotify, Soundcloud, and Youtube APIs to embed a 'music player' for each song on the application.
  
*Goals to complete before next week:*  
 1. Ensure that authentication works seamlessly between Front-End and Back-End.
 2. Deploy Front-End and Back-End on the remote server.
 3. Complete demo for project.
 4. Complete implementation by Saturday night at latest!

### Section 2: Contributions of Individual Team Members

### Suyash:
Goals for previous week: I plan to improve the documentation of our codebase itself as well as help include authentication for BeatParty so we can have accounts for individual users.
Goals for this week: I learned to use Spotify, Soundcloud, and Youtube APIs.
Goals for next week: I plan to help team finish authentication of user profiles in application and deployment of application to remote server as well as write the script for and record the final project demo.

### Yasin:
* Subsection 1: Goals for the previous week: I'll work to help connect the frontend and backend remotely and help on authorizing users through Google
* Subsection 2: This week, I worked on extracting user info when they login with their Google account to use for our database. I also worked on an API that retrieves the songs a given user has voted on so we can make sure we don't have multiple votes per user. Finally, I read up on how HTTPS works and what SSL keys in order to prepare to possible route our app using HTTPS instead of HTTP to make sure our remote deployment works
* Subsection 3: Goals for next week: By next week, I'll work on makking sure authentication works and adjust interface between the frontend and backend as needed. I'll also help with remote deployment if needed. Once implementation of the app is done, I'll help with writing the script for the final demo and finally record it next Tuesday.

### Rohin:
* Subsection 1: Goals for the previous week: By next week, I will work with Ansh to redesign the database and implement API logic to support user logins via Google authentication.
* Subsection 2: I worked with Ansh to support backend authentication and I assisted in solving deployment and frontend authentication issues.
* Subsection 3: By next week, I will write tests for a new backend API that can be used to determine which songs a user has upvoted. I will also help solve any bug issues before the final release.

### Ansh:
Subsection 1: Goals for the previous week: Last week, I planned to work with Rohin to redesign the database and implement API logic to support user logins via Google authentication.
Subsection 2: I added a table to the database mapping users to songs that they liked and added the API to facilitate querying for all the songs liked by a user. I also assisted Rohin in supporting backend authentication and ran the deployed application as a background task to allow for execution even when not on the VM.
Subsection 3: By next week, I will work to solve any bugs preventing us from a smooth release as well as fix some technical issues with deployment.

### Vikram:
