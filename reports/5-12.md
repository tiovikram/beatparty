3. Finalize test suite for Back-End codebase.
4. Host app on remote server. -> pushed back to next week's goals.
  
*Goals accomplished this week:* 
1. Used JSON and Back-End APIs to connect Front-End and Back-End to ensure data from
   Back-End is rendered properly on UI and that user input is properly stored in Back-End.
2. Updated Back-End APIs to include retrieval of song data in both sorted and non-sorted order
   for the 'see top songs' and 'shuffle' functions respectively.
4. Finalized a unit-test Suite for the Back-End codebase.
5. Included URL validation to ensure that only valid links

### Section 2: Contributions of Individual Team Members

### Suyash:
* Goals for previous week: I plan to integrate the Front-End and Back-End using JSON and ensure that data flows properly between both sections of the codebase.
* This week, I used JSON and the Back-End APIs to integrate the Front-End and Back-End components of our application. Additionally, I used React/HTML to improve the layout of the application so that it will be easier for end-users to navigate between different pages on the application.
* Goals for next week: By next week, I plan to help enhancing the features of the BeatParty application as well as write detailed documentation for the app for both developers and users.

### Rohin
* Subsection 1: Goals for the previous week:  By next week, I will flesh out the backend JUnit test suite. I will also work with the rest of the backend team as needed to host the backend remotely.
* Subsection 2: I fleshed out the backend JUnit test suite and helped prepare/present the Beta Release asssignment. We did not get to deploying the bakend to server this week due to beta release requirements, so I will assist the backend team with this task in the coming week as needed.
* Subsection 3: By next week, I will assist in deploying the backend code to a remote server and I will work on setting up integration tests of the bakend. I will also contribute to the backend documentation for next week's assignment.
