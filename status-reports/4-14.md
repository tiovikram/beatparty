## Section 2: Contributions of Individual Team members

### Yasin:
* Subsection 1: Last week's plan. No plan for this week since this is week 1.
* Subsection 2: This week, I contributed to the requirements and policies and helped come up with a rough schedule to work off of.
                As a backend team, we also decided what to work on and divided up tasks for the coming week.
* Subsection 3: By next week, we decided I should draft a data structure/class that abstracts the songs and get more familiar with the Spring framework
                we'll be using. We also thought it would be a good idea for me to start drafting a high-level architecture of our system.
