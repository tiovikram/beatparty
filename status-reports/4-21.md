#### Suyash:

1. Goals for the previous week: I plan to help implement our team's front-end design in ReactJS as well as understand how to connect the front-end of the BeatParty application with the application's back-end. My longer-term goal is to have the home page of our application be complete and functional in 2 weeks.
2. This week, I set up the structure and layout of the front-end of our BeatParty application. I also helped make design decisions that influenced the functionality of our application. Approximately half of the layout of the front-end of BeatParty is complete.
3. Goals for next week: Complete working front-end of application. Stretch goal: Integrate front-end of application with back-end to create working full-stack application.
